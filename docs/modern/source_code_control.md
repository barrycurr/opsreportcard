We're all programmers now. Programmers use source code control.

Things to put in your repository: Your scripts, programs, configuration
files, documentation, and just about anything. If you aren't sure, the
answer is "yes".

Keeping your configuration files in source code control starts out
feeling like a luxury and ends up becoming a lifesaver.

Anything is better than nothing. Use what your developers use. No
developers? Learn Git, Mercurial, or even Subversion. Desperate for a
quick way to save configuration files history?
