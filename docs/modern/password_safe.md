This shows you have a mature way to manage passwords.

There are many excellent software-based password "vaults" systems.
Though an envelope in an actual locked box is often good enough.

The problem is often verification. How do you know that an evil
co-worker isn't putting the wrong password in those envelopes? If you
are that paranoid have a different person verify any new passwords.
