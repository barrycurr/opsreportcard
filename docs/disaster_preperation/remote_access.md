This needs little explanation. Remote consoles (IP-based KVM switches) are inexpensive; good servers have them built in. Remote power control isn't a luxury if the computer is more than a few miles away.

The exception to this rule is grid computing systems with hundreds or thousands of identical machines. If one fails another can take its place.
