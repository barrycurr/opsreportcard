This is a conversion of <https://www.opsreportcard.com/> to Markdown and uses Jekyll to generate a static site.

In addition to the original site a [Contents/Score Card](/docs/contents.md) has been created to track progress, a template for the [Operations Document](/docs/opsdoc/README.md) (as mentioned in [Does Each Service Have An Opsdoc?](/docs/operational/opsdoc.md)) and single pages for the full [Operations Document](/docs/opsrepcard_single.md) and [Operations Document Template](/docs/opsdoc_single.md).
